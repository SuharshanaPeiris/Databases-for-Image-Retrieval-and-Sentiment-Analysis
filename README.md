# Databases-for-Image-Retrieval-and-Sentiment-Analysis
This project built two databases: one for image retrieval based on visual content and another for training sentiment analysis models.  I collected and processed images, extracting features like color and texture. Text data was also collected, cleaned, and converted into numerical formats for sentiment classification.
